Deep Linking with QR Code Scanner (Room DB Integration)
This app supports deep linking on locally stored data using Room Database.

Each product in the database is assigned a unique deep link identifier.

A QR code is generated for each product, containing its deep link.

When a user scans a QR code using the system QR code scanner, the app automatically opens and navigates directly to the specific product details screen associated with that code.
